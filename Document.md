# Sample Node.js Application

This document provides an overview of a sample Node.js application, including its architecture and workflow.

## Application Architecture

The application follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Below is a diagram representing the structure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] -->|HTTP Request| B[Controller]c
    B -->|Processes Request| C[Model]
    C -->|Fetches Data| D[Database]
    C -->|Returns Data| B
    B -->|Sends Response| A
```

## Workflow.

The workflow of the application is illustrated below:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Database

    Client->>Server: Sends HTTP Request
    Server->>Database: Queries Data
    Database-->>Server: Returns Data
    Server-->>Client: Sends HTTP Response
```

## Features

- **Routing**: Handles HTTP requests and directs them to the appropriate controller.
- **Database Integration**: Connects to a database to fetch and store data.
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error handling for various scenarios.
